## Overview

![screenshot](./404/src/assets/snow-globe-img.PNG)

This is my snowy 404 page template. A few thing about my project:

- You can find live project [here](https://404-page-template.vercel.app/)
- My experience with this project I learned how to make svg responsive as well as how to use CSS animations as well as how to apply them to a svg image.
- As an improvement I would animate the snowman to wave when you enter the page and have the lights on the christmas tree change different christmas colors.
- Figma was an intrical part to add and manipulate the svg and be able to change small parts of the image quickly.
